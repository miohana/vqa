## Introduction
A simple Flask app to generate answer given an image and a natural language question about the image. The app uses a deep learning model, trained with Tensorflow, behind the scenes.

## Model Overview
Recent developments in Deep Learning has paved the way to accomplish tasks involving multimodal learning. Visual Question Answering (VQA) is one such challenge which requires high-level scene interpretation from images combined with language modelling of relevant Q&A. Given an image and a natural language question about the image, the task is to provide an accurate natural language answer. This is a Keras implementation of one such end-to-end system to accomplish the task.

The model architecture is based on the paper [Hierarchical Question-Image Co-Attention for Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00061).

## Technical Aspect
The model used in the app is trained on [VQA 2.0](https://visualqa.org/download.html) dataset. The accuracy of the paper on this dataset is 54%. The model used in the Flask app has an accuracy of 49.20%.

## Running the app locally
*The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.*

First, clone this project to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/arya46/VQA_HieCoAtt.git

# change the working directory
cd VQA_HieCoAtt
```
Then install the required packages and libraries. Run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Everything is set now. Use the following command to launch the app:
```
python main.py
```
The app will run on `http://localhost:8080/` in the browser.
